## What is ACI ACRIS

_ACRIS_ is an acronym for “Airport Community Recommended Information Services”, and is one of the working groups under ACI World. Members of the working group are airports, airlines and vendors.
The purpose of this working group is to define standard data models and web interfaces for exchanging operational and passenger related data between the partners in a standardized way.  
Two working group face-to-face meetings are being held each year and additional meetings or conference calls are scheduled as required by the projects and topics. The working group is open for airports, airlines and partners from the aviation industry; participation is on voluntary base. All contribution on meetings or projects is done on the own expense of the participants.  
For more information on ACI ACRIS working group visit the [ACI homepage](http://groups.aci.aero/home) or have a look at the [ACI ACRIS information video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj7xcAauCSo).

## ACRIS Seamless Travel

The Project _Seamless Travel_ in the ACRIS working group has defined a standard data model and interfaces to exchange data between aviation partners:

- Flight data
- Airport data
- Airline data
- Service information
- Service booking
- Trip data
Two documents are describing the background:

- Business Requirement Document (BRD)
- Implementation Guideline

The ACI ACRIS Seamless Travel Standard consist of three components:

1. The BRD
2. The Implementation Guideline
3. Supporting files that contain implementation details for the interfaces and data models (RAML,
   JSON Schema)
